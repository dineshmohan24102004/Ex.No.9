2.A white mother cat is riding a small bicycle or motorbike along a sunny rural road, surrounded by a lush green mango orchard. She is sitting upright, confidently holding the handlebars. In the front basket, her two kittens are riding together — one is white and the other is black, both looking curious and excited. There are no bags or objects hanging from the bike — they are on their way to pick mangoes. The scene is bright and cheerful, with dappled sunlight filtering through mango trees lining the road. A few mangoes hang from low branches nearby, hinting at the destination. The vibe is adventurous and heartwarming, like a family outing.

4.Create a 30-second advertisement video for Cetaphil Face Wash featuring only male characters,
targeting young men with sensitive or acne-prone skin. Start with a close-up of a young man looking at his irritated
skin in the mirror. Show him applying Cetaphil Face Wash with a smooth lather, followed by water rinsing off easily.
Include visuals of calming ingredients like aloe vera and water splashes. Show his skin
visibly clearer and healthier after use. End with him confidently stepping out, smiling. Voiceover:
‘Real care for real skin. Cetaphil – gentle, effective, and made for men.’ Include soft, modern background
music and display the Cetaphil logo at the end.

# Introduction
AI-driven video generation leverages advanced machine learning models to create dynamic visual content based on text prompts. These prompts act as instructions, guiding the AI in selecting elements like scenes, motion, and style. The structure and detail of prompts play a critical role in determining the final video's quality, coherence, and aesthetic consistency.
# Prompting techniques generally fall into two categories:
• Simple prompts: Concise instructions that offer limited guidance, often resulting in more abstract or less refined video outputs.
• Detailed prompts: Rich, descriptive inputs that provide comprehensive direction, promoting clearer narrative flow and stylistic alignment.
Popular AI video generation models, such as those based on GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) or diffusion architectures, rely heavily on prompt precision for optimal performance. This section sets the foundation for analyzing how varying prompt complexities impact generated video characteristics.
# Overview of Prompt Structures: Simple vs. Detailed
In AI video generation, simple prompts typically consist of brief, general instructions, often limited to a few keywords or short phrases. These prompts usually lack specific style or narrative elements, for example: "sunset over mountains". The resulting videos may exhibit broad thematic ideas but often lack clarity and consistent visual details.
By contrast, detailed prompts provide extensive descriptions that include narrative context, stylistic directions, and specific visual attributes. An example might be: "a crisp, golden sunset casting long shadows over rugged mountain peaks, with a peaceful river flowing gently in the foreground, in a painterly, impressionist style". These prompts guide the model to generate videos with higher visual coherence, richer thematic depth, and more nuanced stylistic expression.
The length and specificity of detailed prompts help the AI focus on distinct elements and produce outputs that are more aligned with user intent, enhancing both the clarity and aesthetic consistency of generated videos.
Experimental Setup Using Scenario-Based Report Development
The experiment centers on designing an AI-powered chatbot tailored for customer support in a retail setting. This scenario was adapted to explore video generation by using AI prompts to create visual representations of the chatbot’s functionalities and typical customer interactions.
# Different prompting techniques were employed:
• Simple prompts: Brief instructions illustrating basic chatbot responses and user queries without stylistic details.
• Detailed prompts: Elaborate descriptions capturing the chatbot’s interface, user emotions, and contextual interactions with rich visual cues.
Videos generated from each prompt type were collected and systematically evaluated using criteria focusing on video coherence, stylistic consistency, and overall visual quality. This method enabled an analytical comparison to understand how prompt complexity influences the expressiveness and clarity of AI-generated videos.
Comparative Analysis of Videos Generated from Different Prompts
# The comparison between videos generated from simple versus detailed prompts reveals distinct differences in several key areas:
• Video Quality: Detailed prompts consistently produced higher-resolution visuals with refined textures and smoother transitions, while simple prompts generated more abstract and sometimes pixelated sequences.
• Narrative Clarity: Videos from detailed prompts showcased well-defined storylines and scene progression, reflecting the rich context provided. Conversely, simple prompts often resulted in fragmented or ambiguous narratives.
• Stylistic Consistency: Detailed prompts enforced coherent visual styles aligned with the prompt’s tone (e.g., impressionist, futuristic), whereas simple prompts varied widely in style, sometimes mixing unrelated elements.
• User Engagement: Videos crafted through detailed prompts were more immersive and easier to interpret, suggesting greater user engagement potential.
Example: A detailed prompt about a “golden sunset over mountains with painterly strokes” yielded a visually harmonious and evocative video, unlike the loosely themed output from the simple prompt “sunset mountains.”
While detailed prompts demand more time and effort to construct, they significantly enhance AI-generated video outputs. Simple prompts offer rapid generation but often at the cost of clarity and consistency.
# Conclusion
The experiment highlights that prompt complexity is a decisive factor in shaping AI-generated video quality. Detailed prompts consistently yield videos with enhanced coherence, refined visual quality, and stronger narrative clarity compared to simpler prompts. This underscores the importance of providing rich, descriptive inputs that guide the model’s focus on specific elements and stylistic nuances.
# To optimize results, best practices include:
• Incorporating vivid descriptions of scene composition, emotions, and style.
• Balancing prompt length to avoid overload while ensuring sufficient detail.
• Iteratively refining prompts based on intermediate outputs to better align with desired outcomes.
Future research could explore adaptive prompting strategies that dynamically adjust prompt complexity or integrate multimodal inputs for improved video generation. Additionally, visual summaries and diagrams illustrating prompt impact provide valuable tools to enhance user understanding and prompt engineering efficiency.
